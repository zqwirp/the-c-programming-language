## Character Input and Output

>The standard library provides several functions for reading or writing one character at a time,
>of which getchar and putchar are the simplest. Each time it is called, getchar reads the
>next input character from a text stream and returns that as its value. That is, after
>
>```c
>c = getchar();
>```
>
>the variable c contains the next character of input. The characters normally come from the
>keyboard; input from files is discussed in [Chapter 7](https://kremlin.cc/k&r.pdf).
